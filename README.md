<h1 align="center"><strong>Atomic URL</strong></h1>

This is a proof of concept (POC) of how one builds an actual URL shortener service using serverless computing. 

## NOTE

Atomic-url was created by [Jerry Ng](https://github.com/ngshiheng) and the repo can be found [here](https://github.com/ngshiheng/atomic-url). Although I've heavily modified this to suit my needs, I want to make sure proper credit is given since I did not originally fork this project.

## Requirements

-   A [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) account.
-   Install [Wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler#installation) CLI for Cloudflare Workers deployment.

## Setup

I've written a step-by-step guide for installing this project, which can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/1cefe77478d41bf470f07a84143899e5).
